"Today I gave a book about the Negro Leagues of Baseball to a traveling friend. Its a book I've read more than once and felt that my friend would truly enjoy. It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I'll come across the book again but for me parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.\n\nWell in leafing through the book's pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today even with a Black President is still playing catch up.\n\nexcerpt from Black Diamond:  ""Only one thing is keeping them out of the big leagues and that is the pigmentation of their skin.""

"The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names dates and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson ""Cool Papa"" Bell and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays The St. Louis Stars and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947 major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers and for easy reference purposes a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent skill and just plain style should be celebrated regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)",4
